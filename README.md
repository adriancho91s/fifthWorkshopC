    Programs
* [Program 1](1.AdrianGaitan.Tarea5.c)
  * Description: This program presents the Fibonacci series, which starts with 1 and 0 and progressively sums the last two elements in the series until reaching or just below 10,000.
* [Program 2](2.AdrianGaitan.Tarea5.c)
  * Description: This program prints the sum of the elements in the Fibonacci series between 0 and 100.
* [Program 3](3.AdrianGaitan.Tarea5.c)
  * Description: This program calculates the Lucas series, which is similar to Fibonacci but starts with 2 and 1, and the subsequent terms are the sum of the previous two terms.
* [Program 4](4.AdrianGaitan.Tarea5.c)
  * Description: This program calculates the Pell series, which starts with 0 and 1, and the following terms are calculated as 2 times the previous term plus the term before the previous one.
* [Program 5](5.AdrianGaitan.Tarea5.c)
  * Description: This program calculates the Perrin series, which begins with 3, 0, and 2, and the following terms are the sum of the term two steps back and the term three steps back.
* [Program 6](6.AdrianGaitan.Tarea5.c)
  * Description: This program calculates the Padovan series, which starts with 1, 0, and 0, and the following terms are the sum of the last two terms and the term three steps back.
* [Program 7](7.AdrianGaitan.Tarea5.c)
  * Description: This program calculates the Narayana series, which begins with 1, 1, and 1, and the following terms are the sum of the previous term and the number of pairs of consecutive previous terms.
* [Program 8](8.AdrianGaitan.Tarea5.c)
  * Description: This program calculates the Catalan series, which is used in various combinatorial problems. It starts with 1, 1, and subsequent terms are the sum of the products of previous terms.
